# Fetch Take-Home Assessment

## ðŸ“‚ Project Overview
This repository contains my analysis for the Fetch Senior Data Analyst take-home assessment. The goal was to analyze transaction and user data, identify key insights, and communicate findings to stakeholders.

## ðŸ“œ Files & Structure
- **`fetch_analysis.ipynb`** - The full Jupyter Notebook containing data cleaning, SQL queries, analysis, and visualizations.
- **`stakeholder_summary.md`** - A stakeholder-friendly summary of key findings, data quality issues, and next steps.
- **`data/`** - Folder containing raw datasets:
  - **`PRODUCTS_TAKEHOME.csv`** - Product data.
  - **`TRANSACTION_TAKEHOME.csv`** - Transaction data.
  - **`USER_TAKEHOME.csv`** - User data.

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings
- **Data Quality Issues:** Severe mismatches between the `USERS` and `TRANSACTIONS` tables, duplicate product data, and missing values in key columns.
- **Insights:**  
  - **Health & Wellness:** Baby Boomers contribute the highest percentage of purchases.  
  - **Dips & Salsa:** Tostitos is the top brand.  
  - **User Growth:** While YoY % growth has slowed, total users continue to increase, with 2022 seeing a major spike.  

For a deeper dive, please see the **`fetch_analysis.ipynb`** notebook.

## ðŸ“Œ Next Steps
- Investigate **why most transactions do not match any user**.
- Assess **how closely related the transaction and user data are and whether they can be reliably joined for meaningful analysis.**.
- Analyze **churn and daily active users (DAU)** to complement the YoY growth analysis.
